**🚀 About This Repository
This project is my hands‑on practice space for mastering DSA. It includes:**

✅ Solutions to all problems from the Striver A2Z Sheet

✅ Topic‑wise folders for clean organization

✅ A dedicated Notes.txt file where I document:

**Common mistakes**

Important concepts to remember

Approaches we often forget under pressure

Edge cases and patterns

This repo is meant to be both a learning log and a revision companion.

Create a revision-friendly resource for future interviews

Help others who want a structured reference for the A2Z sheet

❗ Mistakes I made while solving problems

💡 Key insights and patterns

🧪 Edge cases that matter

**✅ Quick revision points**

This file grows as I learn — and it’s meant to be a personal cheat sheet.
